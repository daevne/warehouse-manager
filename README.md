## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/daevne/warehouse-manager.git
   cd warehouse-manager
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application:**

   ```sh
   ember serve
   ```

   The project will be available at **[http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)**.

## Data Handling

The application loads products and warehouse positions from a static JSON file (`/data/mock-data.json`). Data management is handled by the **DataHandlerService** in Ember.js. Products and positions are stored in the **Ember Store**, and modifications are saved in **localStorage**.

### Data Loading Process:

1. On startup, the app checks if there are saved positions in **localStorage**.
2. If saved data exists, it is used; otherwise, data is fetched from the JSON file.
3. The fetched data is pushed into the Ember Store for easy access.

### Updating Positions:

- Users can modify the warehouse position of products.
- Changes are immediately saved in **localStorage** and reflected in the UI.
- The Ember Store is used for data updates.
